## 🏗️ Architecture Achievements

### ✅ Unified Design (vs Scattered TypeScript)

**Before (TypeScript):**
- Scattered implementations across multiple demo directories
- Half-baked examples with missing pieces
- Inconsistent patterns and approaches
- No single source of truth

**After (Go):**
- Single, coherent architecture
- Complete end-to-end implementations
- Consistent patterns throughout
- Unified SDK with clear API surface

### ✅ Production-Ready Features

1. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Proper error types and messages throughout
2. **Standards Compliance** - Full W3C DID/VC specification adherence
3. **Multi-Curve Support** - Ed25519, secp256k1, secp256r1 with proper algorithm mapping
4. **Extensible Design** - Plugin architecture for new payment methods
5. **Performance Optimized** - Native Go performance for crypto operations
6. **Type Safety** - Strong typing prevents runtime errors

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### 1. **Multi-Curve Cryptographic Support**
```go
// Seamlessly works with different curves
ed25519Agent, _ := ack.NewAgent(ack.CurveEd25519, "Agent A")
secp256k1Agent, _ := ack.NewAgent(ack.CurveSecp256k1, "Agent B")
secp256r1Agent, _ := ack.NewAgent(ack.CurveSecp256r1, "Agent C")

// All can verify each other's signatures with proper algorithm selection
```

### 2. **Complete Identity Verification Flow**
```go
// Create challenge → Sign response → Verify signature → Establish trust
challenge, _ := verifier.CreateChallenge(agent.DID.String(), "access")
response, _ := agent.RespondToChallenge(ctx, challenge)
result, _ := verifier.VerifyIdentityResponse(ctx, response, challenge)
// result.TrustLevel indicates verification strength
```

### 3. **Integrated Payment Processing**
```go
// Payment request → Process payment → Generate receipt → Verify receipt
request, _ := service.CreatePaymentRequest(payee, amount, "USDC", desc, methods, exp)
response, _ := service.ProcessPayment(ctx, request, method, payer)
// response.Receipt contains verifiable credential
```

### 4. **Standards-Compliant Implementation**
- **W3C DIDs**: Full parsing, validation, and creation
- **W3C VCs**: Complete credential lifecycle support
- **JWT**: Proper algorithm mapping and verification
- **Multicodec**: Cryptographic key encoding (with base64url fallback)
